## Title:
Survival Capsule-style engineering sections for admemes and station repairs
MODULE ID: ENGINEERING_IN_A_BOX

### Description:
Adds new survival pod-type items that contain miniaturized versions of an Atmospherics distribution center, a passive Proto-Nitrate based Supermatter, and probably more later.  Too busted for general access, but good for events, admeme shenanigans, or saving people from themselves when the station's shot to shit.
