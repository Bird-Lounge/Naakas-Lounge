## Title:
Survival Capsule-style engineering sections for admemes and station repairs
MODULE ID: ENGINEERING_IN_A_BOX

### Description:
Adds new survival pod-type items that contain miniaturized versions of an Atmospherics distribution center, a passive Proto-Nitrate based Supermatter, and probably more later.  Probably too busted to let people have access to (though Cargonia purchase them if a #define is enabled), but good for events, admeme shenanigans, or saving people from themselves when the station's shot to shit.

### TG Proc/File Changes:
None

### Defines:
ENGI_IN_BOX_CARGONIA - in engibox_datums, uncomment to allow Cargo to order the pods.
